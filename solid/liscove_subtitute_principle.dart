//L â€” Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)

//The Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP) states that objects of a superclass should be able to be replaced with objects of a
//subclass without affecting the correctness of the program. In other words, a subclass should be able to replace its superclass
//without breaking the code
